<div class="entry-content"><p>The main trail that comes down through France is called the &lsquo;Le puy&rsquo; trail&mdash;named for its origin city, &lsquo;Le Puy,&rsquo;
France. It&rsquo;s about 800 km long as well, so if one were to hike from Le Puy (and many do), it would be about 1600km.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2008-10-14-the-le-puy-trail/pyrenees_from_plane.jpg" alt="pyrenees from plane" /></p>

<p><em>View down into the Pyrenees on the Madrid-Toulouse flight. I climbed over these mountains!!</em></p>

<p>Since I studied France in college and my French is actually quite good (I always have loved languages), I wanted to hike
part of this trail. I chose a city more or less randomly, about a week from the border, &lsquo;Aire-sur-l&#8217;Adour&rsquo;&mdash;and based my
plans on starting there. On Oct. 1st I flew from SF, arriving in Toulouse on Oct. 2nd. I wandered around Toulouse in a
bit of a daze, got rained on and pretty cold, and wondered why I earth, I ever wanted to do this ridiculous walk! ;)</p>

<p>In this emotionally weak state, I hunted around in my pack for my French language guide to the &lsquo;Le Puy&rsquo; trail,
charmingly called &lsquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Miam-miam-dodo-Compostelle-Puy-en-Velay-Saint-Jean-Pied-Port/dp/2916446109/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b/171-4719513-0558649">Miam Miam Dodo</a>&rsquo; (which means: &lsquo;Yumm yumm, sleep sleep&rsquo;, or more prosaically,
&lsquo;Eating and Sleeping&rsquo;), and started calling various hostels in Aire-sur-l&#8217;Adour. The phone was answered by a very nice
lady who seemed to feel my pain. Yes, they were open. Yes, there were other pilgrims, I would not be all alone. Was the
rainy weather typical? Not very, it was the first time it had rained in two weeks.</p>

<p><em>It was rainy and depressing in Toulouse.</em></p>

<p>I got on a bus from Toulouse to Aire-sur-l&#8217;Adour and we sped away, the driver careening out through the suburbs of
Toulouse and into the countryside. I tried to sleep but was not particularly successful. The bus was full of rural
French folks, poorer types. Mothers with children, immigrants, workers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2008-10-14-the-le-puy-trail/french_bus.jpg" alt="french bus" /></p>

<p><em>French regional bus that took me from Toulouse to Aire-sur-l&#8217;Adour.</em></p>

<p>At 7pm, it was dark, raining, and the bus dropped me off basically on the side of the road. I chose a direction again,
more or less at random, and started walking. After a few minutes, I crossed the &lsquo;Adour&rsquo; river, and came into a square.
There were a few men in a cafe, but I didn&rsquo;t feel up to asking them how to find the hostel, so I kept walking. I came
upon the cathedral. A man walked by, walking his dog. &lsquo;Are you a pilgrim?&rsquo; he asked. He shook my hand and said that he,
too, had done the walk. He led me through the dark, empty streets and pointed up a hill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about five minutes walk
up there, on the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I walked into the albergue. It was full of people. One man was getting his feet treated for blisters. &ldquo;Where have you
come from?&rdquo; They asked me. They thought that I had come in from walking that day, and did not realize that I had just
essentially gotten off the plane. They were quite welcoming, gave me some of the meal they had prepared, and a ton of
wine.</p>

<p><em>The couple that ran the albergue. It was a private albergue, as distinguished from the municipal ones. The husband had
walked the entire trail (Le Puy&mdash;Santiago) 7 times!</em></p>
