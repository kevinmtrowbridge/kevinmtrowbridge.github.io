<h1>Family Tree</h1>

<p>Ok the vision for this page, is to collect the data for my direct ancestors.  It can be expanded at some point in the
future to include the information for the other branches of the family tree, but that is a much larger job.</p>

<p>It will show the past as a collection of nuclear families.  The bios of individuals will be placed with their children.
Ie, they&rsquo;ll be with the nuclear family where they were parents.</p>

<h3 id='janet-louise-trowbridge'>Janet Louise Trowbridge</h3>


<p>Born: December, 18, 1951 at Little Traverse Hospital in Petoskey, Michigan
Parents: George Elmer Wurst and Venita Jane Forshee
Siblings: Robert Dale Wurst, Ginger Lee Wurst
Spouse: Michael Andrew Trowbridge
Children: Kevin Michael Trowbridge, Jason Andrew Trowbridge</p>

<p>Current Activities: As of 2006, I have been helping my husband, Mike, with the field work of our surveying business, for
the past 3 years. Sometimes it is really physically hard work, like the swamp jobs we have had, but most of the time
it&rsquo;s just a lot of walking which is really good exercise. We work well together and people ask us, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still working
together and still talking?&rdquo; We laugh and say, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I have always done his bookkeeping. Also, I work part time for our
accountant, helping him monthly, totaling their Petoskey stores&#8217; sales and more during the income tax season, processing
tax returns.</p>

<p>Past Activities: 1978-1995 I was the Treasurer for Pleasant View Twp, which allowed me to stay home while our two boys
were growing up. Lots of memories about that time slot.</p>

<p>I went to school at Littlefield Public School in Alanson and graduated in 1970. The year after I graduated I worked for
the School, helping the secretary with the bookkeeping and clerical duties in the office. Then I worked for several
accountants in Petoskey.</p>

<p>I met my husband, Mike, in 1973, at Little Caesar&rsquo;s in Petoskey. We eloped on December 5, 1975, and were married at the
court house in Petoskey (much to chagrin of my Mother, who thought we should have at least been married by a minister)
and moved into the house we were building, over the hill east of the family farm. Sometime in January, our neighbor,
Tina Werden, organized a surprise shivaree for us, with people banging pans and shooting off shotguns (Carl Lutz had a
ball). I have no idea how many friends and relatives crowded into our house, but after everyone came in my brother
announced that the party was at his house. We went as we were dressed. My high school girlfriend told me I was the most
casually dressed bride she&rsquo;d every seen, in my turtleneck and blue jeans.</p>

<p>I grew up on a small dairy farm 3 miles north of Conway. As I think about my growing up years, I&rsquo;m just beginning to
realize how rich a life I had. There was always something to do: getting the cows in the barn morning and night for my
Mom to milk them. I would get them in their stanchions, give them salt and spray them down so the flies didn&rsquo;t bother
them. (I wonder now about that spray) When I was younger, at night, sometimes I would go with my brother, Bob, on
Trigger our horse, to take the cows over the hill to the spring to water them. I didn&rsquo;t like going down that steep hill
to the spring, every step Trigger took I was pushed farther up his neck, til I felt like I was around his ears. Then
Trigger would wade in the mud up to his knees to the water trough, and I was positive that if I fell off I&rsquo;d never get
out of the mud.</p>

<p>I always had lots of pets: our Collie dogs, Lassie, Tippy and Bingo, cats, ducks, a rabbit, we had a parakeet for a long
time and I always tried to teach it to say something, but it never talked. Hmm!</p>

<p>I used to do chores for my Mom, like taking my wagon down to the big barn and getting kindling for the cook stove,
pulling weeds in the garden and taking them down to the pigs, taking my dog and going over the hill to pick
blackberries. I also liked being my Dad&rsquo;s &lsquo;handy girl&rsquo; and ran little errands for him as he tinkered out in his shop or
when I was older, helping him rake the hay. Sometimes he took me deer hunting in the old jeep. What fun!</p>

<p>My cousins, Mike Johanson or Kim Jones and his family would come for a vacation, then I had someone to play with:
restaurant up in the barn playhouse, swinging on the hay rope in the top of the barn, or building a tunnel in the hay,
going to town on the old buckboard, climbing trees, riding Trigger, climbing the walls of the red barn and walking
across the beams to the other side. The days seemed endless.</p>

<p>2-11-2007 - I told a story from my past to my sister-in-laws recently and thought I should write it here before it sunk
back into unretrievible inner space.</p>

<p>My big sister who is six years older than me, who I learned to becareful around because she seemed to like to play
tricks on me, was also my mentor, my teacher. Three separate things come to mind: when she was a cheerleader she
practiced cheers at home and taught them to me. She begged me to be a junior cheerleader, but I was too shy and wouldn&rsquo;t
do it (but I knew all the cheers).</p>

<p>When she took typing in 9th or 10th grade(I was in 4th or 5th) and brought her lessons home, I started playing with them
on our old typewriter and I remember Mom saying, &ldquo;Boy, I think you better teach her how to type right so she doesn&rsquo;t
develop any wrong habits.&rdquo; So Ginger taught me how to type and the first day in typing class, of course I took off right
pecking away at the exercises. All the other kids stopped typing and looked at me and the teacher came down and asked me
where I learned to type. She smiled at my answer. That was the one and only class I took in high school where no one
could catch up with me. I found something I was good at and loved it!</p>

<p>The third thing my sister taught me was how to play the piano. We had early lesson books at home and for some reason she
started me out with those first lessons. I took it from there, teaching myself from then on. Years later I took some
piano lessons and my teacher said my fingering was pretty good. And I guess my years in band, blowing on that &lsquo;killer&rsquo;
clarinet we had, helped me learn the notes all the better. Today I play our piano a little, not as much as I used to,
but I still enjoy music.</p>

<h3>George Elmer Wurst</h3>

<p>Born: September 25, 1915, in Brutus, Michigan
Died: July 22, 2004, @ Northern Michigan Hospitals in Petoskey, Michigan</p>

<p>Parents: Carl Frederick Wurst and Edith Dorothy Burgess</p>

<p>Siblings: John Ernest Wurst, Eleanore Lee Wurst, Arlene Florence Wurst, Doris Faith Wurst, Carol Joyce Wurst</p>

<p>Spouse: Venita Jane Forshee married on June 11, 1938</p>

<p>Children: Louis Ray Wurst (died as infant), Robert Dale Wurst, Ginger Lee Wurst, Janet Louise Wurst</p>

<h4>Life</h4>

<p>George Elmer Wurst was born at Kents Farm on Red School Road, north of Brutus,at 4:00am on September 25, 1915. Dr.
O&#8217;Brein and Grace Burgess (Edith&rsquo;s mother) were attending.</p>

<p>When he was very young his parents moved to Alanson where his Dad worked at the boathouse on Crooked River. He
remembered the wooden sidewalks there and, when the Kaiser was burned in effigy at the end of W.W.I on the main street
of town.</p>

<p>The family then moved to Petoskey in 1921 where Elmer attended Central School. In his youth he delivered newspapers and
had fond memories of the swimming hole in the Russian Swamp, and riding bobsleds down Mitchell Street across the bridge
to the waterfront. Sometimes as many as 60 people would ride on one sled. A man would stand at the railroad crossing and
swing a lantern if a train was coming. In the unfortunate event of a train the only brakes the sled had were the riders&#8217;
feet!</p>

<p>He quit school in the 10th grade during the depression and went to work shoveling coal from train cars with his Dad and
uncle, Lynn Burgess. At age 18 he worked at the CCC(Civilian Conservation Corps) Camp in Wilderness for 1 year building
fire lanes, roads and cabins. After that he worked for the Portland Cement Co., and then did carpentry work. Elmer
married Venita Jane Forshee on June 11, 1938. Their wedding reception was a memorable one for many in the community
since it was a barn dance! The barn was not yet full of hay and was decorated and a piano was hoisted to the 2nd floor
hayloft. Food and dancing was enjoyed by all. Elmer quit building houses in the Petoskey area about 1941 to work full
time on the farm, raising cows and white turkeys. He contracted polio in December 1949 and was in a wheelchair, but
never allowed this to slow him down. He re-shingled the roof of the big barn, built a new cement porch on the front of
the house, worked the fields on his tractor, and loved to go deer hunting. He was Supervisor of Pleasant View Township
for 27 years, retiring in 1988.</p>

<p>In retirement, he always had some project going to keep busy. In the summer, he kept his yard mowed, dug up flower bulbs
and re-planted them, for a while he had honey bees, and tinkered in his shop. In the winter, he would paste newspaper
articles in big wallpaper books (there are many of these)and put genealogy information into his computer. These are just
a few of his pastimes.</p>

<p>There was always someone visiting, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and friends. He welcomed everyone and
loved to visit and share stories.</p>

<h3>Venita Jane (Forshee) Wurst</h3>

<p>Born: June 16, 1915 in Conway, Michigan
Died: March 3, 2000 at Northern Michigan Hospitals in Petoskey, Michigan</p>

<p>Parents: Frank Forshee and Elsie Jane Cameron</p>

<p>Siblings: Irma Maxine Forshee</p>

<p>Spouse: George Elmer Wurst married June 11, 1938</p>

<p>Children: Louis Ray Wurst(died at 2 months), Robert Dale Wurst, Ginger Lee Wurst, Janet Louise Wurst</p>

<h4>Life</h4>

<p>Jane was born in Conway, Michigan. In 1921 her parents moved to a farm on Edward Road, three miles north of Conway, in
Pleasant View Township.</p>

<p>Jane attended grade school at the Linehan School, which was a one room school house on the corner of North Conway and
Valley Roads one mile north and west of where they lived. She went to high school in Petoskey, graduating in 1932.</p>

<p>As a young adult, Jane worked at the Purple Inn, a summer hotel in the Petoskey area. By the pictures that were taken
there, it looked like that was a fun time in her life. She also worked for summer residents as a mother&rsquo;s helper when a
teenager. Being a farm girl she also enjoyed riding her horse and taking care of the animals. This proved to be a
valuable skill later on in life when her husband was disabled by polio, and the family farm chores became her sole
responsibility.</p>

<p>Jane married George Elmer Wurst on June 11, 1938 in Petoskey. Rev. George Weaver was the minister. Their wedding
reception was a barn dance in the top of the &ldquo;big barn&rdquo;. An event that is still talked about today by many of their
neighbors.</p>

<p>Jane was a mother first but was also active in the community. She served on the Pleasant View Twp board as treasurer and
clerk and on the Alanson Littlefield Public School board. She was an &lsquo;Avon Lady&rsquo; for a few years and then started
working part-time for the Behan family in Petoskey. That became a full time job in the mid-1960&rsquo;s, as she worked in
Behan&rsquo;s home and also down at their store, PUMCO. She retired from there in 1981 and retired from the township board in
1988.</p>

<p>She enjoyed playing the piano. Dad mentioned one time that the piano wasn&rsquo;t brought down out of the big barn for a
couple years after their reception. However, that did not deter her, as she would go up in the barn to play it. She also
played a pump organ at the Sunny Ridge Sunday School. Once in the middle of a hymn she let out a screech as a mouse
jumped out of the organ and ran across the church. The congregation and Jane collected themselves after a period of
laughter and resumed singing the hymn.</p>

<p>Jane always had a cake ready to eat and a cup of coffee for anyone who happened to stopped by to visit or to use the
phone. Neighbors frequently stopped by to use the phone since it was the only one in the neighborhood. She was known for
her infectious laughter, empathy for others problems, and what seemed at times to be her never ending energy.</p>

<p>Sometimes the infectious laughter got Jane into trouble when serious matters were the rule. For instance, once when
serving jury duty she started giggling, at a prominent lawyer&rsquo;s shoes! He look very professional in his three piece
suit, but boasted a pair of what mom called &ldquo;Jesus slippers&rdquo; on his feet which sent her into a fit of giggles. The more
she tried to hold the giggles back the worse her situation grew until most of the jury had contracted the same
infectious giggle. Just as she thought she had the humorous laughter under control it would break out all over again.</p>

<p>Jane loved her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She sponsored knitting and sewing 4-H clubs for the
local children. She also was the mom who made sure all the neighborhood boys and girls made it to athletic events.
Starting at her house, picking up the basketball team and cheerleaders on her way to the school. By the time she reached
the school she frequently had most of the starting team in her car. Late one stormy night on the way home from a
basketball game she made the comment that she was not worried since she had so many kids in the car to push her out of
the ditch if that should befall us.</p>

<p>Most of the time it was hard to see who was having more fun, Jane or her kids. She was the mom that enjoyed spontaneous
neighborhood sledding parties. Frequently she would hop on the bobsled loaded with children to take a turn down the
ice-packed hill. She could always be counted on to supervise school dances. Especially if she and her friends could do
the two-step, polka or waltz around the dance floor several times during the evening.</p>

<p>Despite her busy schedule Jane made time to assemble scrapbooks documenting her children growing up. These have become
treasured books full of happy memories for her descendants.</p>

<h3>Carl Frederick Wurst</h3>

<p>Born: April 25, 1890 in Brutus, Emmet County, Michigan
Died: August 2, 1978 in Petoskey, Michigan</p>

<p>Parents : John Wurst and Rosina Reader</p>

<p>Siblings : Adolph Wurst(brother), Freda Christina Wurst(sister), Gottlieb Christian Wurst(brother), Lena Magdalena
Wurst(sister), Pauline Rosa Wurst(sister)</p>

<p>Spouse: Edith Dorothy Burgess</p>

<p>Marriage date: May 6, 1914 in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan</p>

<p>Children: George Elmer Wurst, John Ernest Wurst, Eleanore Lee Wurst, Arlene Florence Wurst, Doris Faith Wurst, Carol
Joyce Wurst</p>

<h4>Life</h4>

<p>(From the Burgess Family History Book - By Doris Wurst Jay)(Additions by Ginger Burdick)</p>

<p>Carl attended the Little Red School House in Brutus, Michigan. He quit school in the 4th grade. He lost a great deal of
his hearing after a bout of measles, and many thought he was not &ldquo;overly bright.&rdquo; Quite the contrary was true. As Carl
grew older he proved to be a creative and gifted thinker as well as a hard worker.</p>

<p>Carl held many jobs; he worked for the City of Petoskey on a road crew; was a city police officer for a short time
(didn&rsquo;t like that job!). In 1926 he went to work at Penn Dixie Cement Co. in Petoskey, Mi where he became a Master
Mechanic. He was in the machine shop there for 17 years. After he retired, he worked as a custodian in an exclusive
clothing store in Petoskey. He was very proud of the cleanliness of &ldquo;his&rdquo; store and the high polish he could put on the
floors.</p>

<p>Besides planting a large garden, Carl was a tinkerer and inventor. During World War II he invented a milkweed pod
picker. Milkweed floss was being used in life preserver jackets and there was a great demand for them. His picture was
in the local paper for his invention. He also invented an automatic road sander, which attached to the back of a truck,
making it much easier to sand the many hills in Petoskey during the wintry days. He also invented a type of cruise
control. Since he never applied for a patent, he never made any money for his inventions. He loved to carve things,
toys, chains, and animals.</p>

<p>Keith Burgess remembers the &ldquo;farm&rdquo; with its spring fed pond, driving Uncle Carl&rsquo;s &ldquo;Doodlebug&rdquo;, and the old cars to climb
into.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;farm&rdquo; was a piece of property in Brutus which Carl inherited from his parents and has passed down to his
descendents. It consists of an A-frame cabin and a pond. It was a great escape for Carl and Edith. A place the family
could have a picnic, stay overnight, and children could play in the pond, swimming, rafting and catching frogs. To this
day the farm is a place where four generations of Carl and Ediths descendents can enjoy.</p>

<p>(A memory from Janet Wurst&rsquo;s childhood, 5 or 6 years old) I remember one winter Grandpa Wurst carved a huge Paul Bunyan
in the circle of their driveway. Mom took a picture of Bob, Ginger and I on it. I was sitting in the lap of &lsquo;Mr Bunyan&rsquo;,
I think Bob was standing on one of the shoulders. I guess I better get the picture out to review where Ginger was. Does
anyone else remember Paul Bunyan?</p>

<p>(More from D. Jay) I sure do remember Dad&rsquo;s Paul Bunyan; also many other snow &ldquo;statues&rdquo; he created. There&rsquo;s a picture of
it around somewhere. Were our winters that much worse then? I remember when Dad, Elmer and Ernie shoveled the drive from
the house out, to Harvey Street then. Maybe I was just that small but the snow on each side was like a huge wall. And
they didn&rsquo;t do it just once in a winter, but often! I have to laugh (and cry) at Jen&rsquo;s recollections. Of course, I
didn&rsquo;t know about their &ldquo;private&rdquo; communications! What I do recall was when she loved to meet him in the garden and he
would select and peel a cuke so they could eat it together. He made the peels sooo thin, said all the flavor and &ldquo;good
stuff&rdquo; was right there.</p>

<p>(memories from Jennifer Jay&rsquo;s childhood) I think I was the most fortunate of all the grandkids as Grandma and Grandpa
Wurst lived right behind us, so I got to visit every day! I remember the smell of his pipe and the speaker he made out
of half of a phone receiver and hooked up to the TV so he could hold it to his ear and hear the TV. I remember that he
liked Walter Conkrite and I think he wrote him letters. Grandpa taught me how to play checkers and encouraged me to
climb higher in the cherry tree in our yard (despite the warning of grandma and my mom). I loved going to the farm with
him and remember him pushing me and Ricky and Jimmy Babcock and Mark and Bruce Johanssen around in a wheelbarrow at the
farm. He was my playmate on our many long trips to Florida and we would play &ldquo;inky pinky&rdquo;, which both he and grandma
were terrible at, but made me laugh. My favorite of all memories though was when the Babcocks bought Grandpa a
fibre-optic light and we had a secret code that when I went to bed on time, I would blink my bedroom light on and off
three times and then he would stand in their dining room window (plain view from my bedroom) and turn on the light for
me and blow me a kiss goodnight. It was our secret ritual and when I found the same kind of light at a garage sale last
year, I bought it! I remember one time when Grandpa was in the hospital and I was too young to visit, but he wanted to
see me, so I stood outside the hospital where he could see me from his window and held up a big sign for him. He sent me
a card the next day, with a fuzzy bird on the outside, and I still have it. His handwriting was very unique and he
always spelled my name &ldquo;Janifer&rdquo;. I have cards from both Grandma and Grandpa that I treasure.</p>

raised. Her grandchildren are an important part of her life. Many hours are spent sewing, babysitting, and enjoying the
company of her grandchildren.</p>

<p>Past Activities:
Ginger was raised on a farm north of Conway. It was a fascinating and fun place to live with all the
animals and activities that farm life has to offer. As a teenager she lived with summer families as a mother&rsquo;s helper
and babysitter for several years before going to work at the Bay View Inn owned by one of her high school teachers and
her husband Janice and Stafford Smith. Many memories and friendships were made during the seven summers spent at the Bay
View Inn. Ginger graduated from Alanson High School in 1963, completed an Associates degree at North Central Michigan
College, and a B.S. in Language Arts with a secondary teaching certificate from Central Michigan University. She taught
9th grade English one year at Besser Jr. High in Alpena, Michigan. The rest of her teaching career of was at Petoskey
Middle School teachng 7th grade Language Arts. Again many memories and friendship were made during her teaching career.
Students and teaching staff were her extended family for 28 years. Ginger and her husband Jim, an electrician, started
their life together in a little house on State St. in Harbor Springs, Michigan where their first two children, Susan and
Timothy, were born. In 1973 Jim built a home on Intertown Rd. South of Petoskey where one more child, Carol, was born
and they raised their family. It was a small farm of 10 acres designed to let their children enjoy the same life they
did, being raised in the country. In 1982 Jim cleared a swampy lot on Paradise Lake near Mackinaw, Mi. and built a small
cabin. Many fun family weekends, summer and winter, were spent swimming, fishing, and boating on Paradise Lake.
Eventually the cabin was replaced with a cottage on Crooked Lake being closer to home.</p>
