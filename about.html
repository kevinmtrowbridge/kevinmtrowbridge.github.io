  <h2>About</h2>

<p><img class="headshot" src="/images/kevin-trowbridge-headshot.jpg"
     alt="Kevin Trowbridge headshot" title="Kevin Trowbridge headshot"></p>

<p>I was raised on a Northern Michigan farm by a large and loving family. After graduating
<a href="http://www.alansonvikings.net/">high school</a>
as valedictorian,
I studied Electrical Engineering at
<a href="http://www.mtu.edu/">Michigan Technological University</a>.</p>

<p>During and after college, I spent about five years traveling in Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Mexico learning French,
and Spanish.  After a while, I got tired of moving around.  So, I decided to settle in a large American coastal city.
I was lucky enough to land a job in Northern California.</p>

<p>Since 2006, I&rsquo;ve been
<a href="/2013-04-09-moving-to-san-francisco">immersed in San Francisco</a>,
meeting my wife Meg, and a wonderful group of friends.</p>

<h4>Software Development Work</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by computers since I was a kid.  My parents wouldn&rsquo;t allow my brother and I to have a Nintendo,
because, they said, &ldquo;It made you get into fights.&rdquo;  Instead, I remember my dad bringing home a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000#Tandy_1000_HX_.26_TX">Tandy 1000-TX</a>.  My first operating system was DOS 3.2.
I actually wore out the spine on the books they gave my dad in the Radio Shack when he bought the computers:
&ldquo;Learn MS-DOS, Basics&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Learn MS-DOS, Advanced&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;Tutor DOS&rdquo; certificate from 1989 is one of my proudest possessions:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tutor-dos-certificate-kevin-trowbridge.jpg"
    alt="Kevin Trowbridge 'Tutor DOS' certificate." title="Kevin Trowbridge 'Tutor DOS' certificate."></p>

<p>I moved on to writing programs in MS-BASIC.  I hacked my TI-85 so that I could transfer assembly programs onto it via a
serial cable.  In high school I was into BBSes and  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TradeWars_2002">Tradewars 2002</a>.
Then, I got free dial-up access to the early  internet through my local community college.  WWW had not been invented
yet, but there was email (my first email address was <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x6b;&#x6d;&#x74;&#x72;&#x6f;&#119;&#x62;&#x72;&#64;&#x73;&#x75;&#110;&#x6e;&#x79;&#x2e;&#110;&#x63;&#x6d;&#x63;&#46;&#99;&#x63;&#46;&#x6d;&#105;&#x2e;&#117;&#x73;">&#x6b;&#x6d;&#116;&#114;&#111;&#x77;&#x62;&#x72;&#64;&#x73;&#117;&#110;&#110;&#x79;&#x2e;&#x6e;&#99;&#109;&#x63;&#46;&#x63;&#99;&#46;&#x6d;&#105;&#x2e;&#117;&#115;</a>), ftp, telnet, and gopher.  My
brother, friends, and I would play Wolfenstein 3D by dialing one anothers houses via modem.  Then, we discovered
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUME</a>, a text-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> we connected to via
telnet.  It&rsquo;s like World of Warcraft with reading and typing.</p>

<p>A key experience was the day I first opened up Gopher.  I had been used to exploring computer programs and trying to
find all their &ldquo;screens&rdquo; &ndash; but, I realized, it was completely impossible to see all the &ldquo;screens&rdquo; in Gopher.  It was
practically infinite, for an individual.  My mind exploded.</p>

<p>So, in college among other things I began creating websites and programming in Java.  I was very inspired by
Google&rsquo;s rise in the early 2000s and, so when it came time to settle down the dream of doing something great with
computers was a bright star for me.  Although my degree was in Electrical Engineering and Technical Writing, I came up
with the plan of marketing myself as a Technical Writer with an Engineering degree.  I thought this made me appear
over-qualified and, might give me an edge.  The plan worked and in 2005 I was hired as a Junior Technical Writer by
<a href="http://www.ariba.com/">Ariba</a>.  After this, my friend Anthony Yam asked me to come create a QA team for his infant
startup  <a href="http://www.spongecell.com/">Spongecell</a>.  Spongecell was written mainly in Ruby on Rails.  And the rest, so
they say, is history.</p>

<p>Since 2010 I have worked as an Independent Software Consultant specializing in Ruby on Rails &amp; HTML5 web and mobile
applications, among other things. I work with a number of clients including
<a href="http://www.thebolditalic.com">The Bold Italic</a>,
<a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a>,
<a href="http://creativebug.com">Creativebug</a>, among many others.</p>

<p>I enjoy software development.  In recent years I feel I have been getting more mature at it.  I&rsquo;m very interested in
software development as an extension of literacy.  I see computer programming as a sort of writing or poetry, where your
audience is both the users of your program, and the other programmers who will have to read, understand, extend, and
maintain it.</p>

<p>I also enjoy working with people: I enjoy the creative process, good communication, and relationship building. I am good
at understanding how I can be helpful in different work contexts, communicating a vision of what I can offer, and
negotiating with different team members to do the best work possible under the circumstances.</p>

<h4>Personal</h4>

<p>I also enjoy <a href="/blog/categories/reading/">reading</a> and writing, <a href="/2013-06-20-the-breakers-blues-band">music</a> (I play the
guitar and  sing), history, <a href="/2008-10-14-a-map">walking</a>, weightlifting, seeing
<a href="http://www.thesingingwriter.com/">theater</a>
and
<a href="http://www.chineseballroomimprov.com/">improv comedy</a>
shows, and
spending quality time with friends and family.</p>
