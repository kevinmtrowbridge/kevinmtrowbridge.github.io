<div class="entry-content"><p>Unfortunately there is much more to write than I have the appetite (or time) for!  I will have to try to catch up later.</p>

<p>The first few days of walking were quite hard.  At the end of the first day, I wrote to Meg (using the iPhone, more on
that later):</p>

<blockquote><p>I was standing in the cabine telephonique five minutes ago trying to call you … but having some issues with the old
telephone card … and extremely tired / freezing from the autumn weather here, so decided to write you an email instead.
Tomorrow night (ie around 9-12 am PST) I will make a bigger effort with the telephone.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that I am quite happy, experiencing a volcano of socialability here in the olde EU… ;) In a real
small and cute French town … soo tired though!! Holy crap. I will sleep like a freaking baby.</p>

<p>It rained today (but only for a few hours) and we walked 30km which is plenty far&mdash;the French part of the camino does
not have as many historic sites as the Spanish part … but it seems to have quite good accomadations and there are a
surprising # of pilgrims considering the time of year.</p></blockquote>

<p>The churches in France have not been well maintained.  When I visted Mathieu in Bourges, we went to see the cathedral
there&mdash;which is huge&mdash;one of the most interesting things about it, I thought, was that all of the statues had been
left in their post-French-revolution state, that is to say&mdash;they had all had their heads chopped off.  So you saw the
typhanum of the cathedral with a bunch of headless statues.  So&mdash;in terms of the history of France and Spain, France s
tripped the church of the majority of its possessions and power at the time of the revolution, that is, 1792, whereas
in Spain, the church retained / retains much more power, and folks are more religious in general.  For example, tonight
here in Pamploma at 7:30 the church bells rang and the streets were full of older folks walking to the cathedral for
mass.  This has a direct effect on the quality of the art / preservation of the churches you see along the route.
Anyways, that is my theory.  I suppose it must be more complicated than that, since there are some beautiful and well
maintained churches in France, but I would wager the theory would hold up en gross.</p>

<p><em>The facade of the church of the church in Pimbo.</em></p>

<p>As we can see, it&rsquo;s in quite poor shape. The statues are missing from
the tympanum and the archivolt seems to have been disassembled and reassembled at some point, as it is inconsistent:
there are plain blocks, blocks with geometric shapes, and a small section that contains figures.</p>

<p>Here is a detail photo of the small figures you see at the top of the rightmost column:</p>

<p><em>Detail of surviving figures on capital of column of Pimbo&rsquo;s church.</em></p>

<p>Pimbo had other attractions though, a beautiful albergue with a very nice hostess who welcomed us and served us coffee.
It is somehow a heavenly experience, to be practically dead from 10 miles of walking, and then to stagger into the most
convivial little room with posters, chairs, a cat, and a charming lady who serves you coffee and questions you about
your experience.</p>

<p><em>The auberge hostess at Pimbo who served us coffee and made very pleasant conversation.</em></p>

<p>Here is Andrea with the auberge&rsquo;s cat&mdash;they had worked out a compromise on the seating arrangement.</p>

<p><em>Cats make good company.</em></p>

<p>Later that evening we came into Arzacq-Arraziguet, got our first view of the Pyrenees in the distance, and ate a very
nice meal with the other pilgrims.  I was surprised by how many there were, perhaps 20-30…</p>

<p>Our first view of the Pyrenees:</p>
