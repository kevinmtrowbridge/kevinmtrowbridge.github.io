<div class="entry-content"><p>NOTE: Meg and I were married on November 16th, 2013.  That&rsquo;s about 1.5 years ago at this point.  We got engaged during a
trip to Costa Rica in November 2012.  Our wedding was a fascinating and completely consuming process and, occasioned
many &ldquo;deep thoughts.&rdquo;  I have attempted to capture some of them here.</p>

<h1>Basic attitude: what&rsquo;s actually happening here?</h1>

<p>A wedding is a transaction between a community and a couple.  The couple is legitimized, and promised aid in their
future growth, and the couple, in turn, swears a most excellent oath that they truly do love, and will love one another,
and help one another to grow in the best possible way.</p>

<p>Much of the advice given to couples emphasizes an egoistic point of view: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my / our special day.&rdquo;  But, really it
is a &ldquo;community building&rdquo; event.  You&rsquo;re telling a story to your community about itself and your role within it.  Focus
on your mate and your wedding guests: with such potent and wonderful raw ingredients as a wedding is made of, you
literally cannot fail.</p>

<h2>The importance of focusing&mdash;and punting on the other things</h2>

<p>Too many people try to &ldquo;do it all&rdquo; &hellip; a wedding planner friend told me stories of $1000 bags of rose petals and such &hellip;
pick just a few &ldquo;special things&rdquo; and focus your efforts on those.  Punt or make the minimum necessary effort on the
others.  You only need a few truly memorable things to make your wedding a great success.</p>

<p>We focused on:</p>

<ul>
<li>choosing a most excellent venue: it was at a summer camp, and once they arrived, no one had to drive anywhere</li>
<li>performances of music and theater: a live band, the Talent Show</li>
<li>the photo boards (this was Kevin&rsquo;s big project)</li>
</ul>


<p>We punted on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the food (we gave slight guidance and then delegated to the chef completely)</li>
<li>the music (outside of the live band, we had a Spotify playlist)</li>
<li>the place cards (we just bought a set of cardboard numbers for $15 and printed an Excel spreadsheet of seat assignments)</li>
</ul>


<h2>If things go wrong</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re not doing it all yourself.  People bring their best selves to a wedding&ndash;if  anything goes wrong, you will have
help.  I remember, when we wanted to go to &ldquo;The Boogie Barn,&rdquo; we hadn&rsquo;t  figured out how to carry over the keg from the
dining hall.  In the actuality, there was a team of 5 burly guys who  carried it wherever we went.  When loading or
unloading things, we had more helpers than we  knew what to do with.</p>

<p>After all, as Cole Porter said: it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nice work if you can get it.&rdquo;  So relax, and savor  this once in a lifetime
experience.  You will never again have the people you love most in the world collected together,  for this reason.  As
in any creative act, be in awe of your ingredients, and put them together simply, with   good timing.</p>

<p>The reality of the love that underlies human community will pierce through your humble situation and it won&rsquo;t be just
any wedding, it will be the wedding, the one archetypal wedding, you will play the archetypal roles &hellip; the  fierceness,
the brightness, the tenderness, the hope for the future, the reality of the pain and loss in the past, the mystery of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s is all about?&rdquo; &hellip;  it will all
create a beautiful, mystical feeling &hellip; and, the psychological transformation to your new life stage, will be
accomplished.</p>

<h1>Practicalities</h1>

<h2>Choosing a venue (more space and time is better)</h2>

<p>Each hour is precious.  Your goal is to enable more &ldquo;quality  time&rdquo; and reduce time spend figuring out banal logistics.
The guests will not self-organize very much just out of  shyness, uncertainty, inertia, and other things to do.</p>

<p>When we have traveled for weddings, say to New York City, with my unusually well organized college friends &hellip;  I was
impressed by how much time we <em>did not</em> spend together.  The friends stayed in different areas of the city, or even  in
the same area, but separated by 10-20 blocks &hellip; it looks small on a map but, in the morning when you consider:  &ldquo;Where
to get coffee?&rdquo; 20 blocks is barrier that blocks coordinated activity.  Also, the huge city has a pull of its  own, away
from the focus of your wedding.</p>

<p>These are a few of the reasons why we preferred a rural location for our wedding: we rented a summer camp.  Once the
guests arrived on Friday night, they could park their cars, and not drive again until Sunday afternoon.  Most everyone
slept onsite, and all meals were served onsite.  We were so happy with this decision.  It was a
fundamental choice which made everything easier, cheaper, and created space and time to allow wedding energy to be
focused.</p>

<p>Of course the summer camp idea isn&rsquo;t for everyone.  I think some of the ideas could be adapted to any wedding: getting
the cooperation of  a bar or restaurant to be the &ldquo;community bar&rdquo; for the weekend, for example, would give folks a
single  geographic location to focus on.  Consider the problem of what to do the night before the wedding: often the
wedding party will do their &ldquo;rehearsal dinner&rdquo; and leave everyone else in dark. If simple plans were laid just: &ldquo;Billy&rsquo;s
Pizzaria is the official restaurant for the wedding and everyone should meet up there on Friday night&rdquo; then, the wedding
party can join the other party as soon as they are done with their rehearsal, and you&rsquo;ve created a fantastic night,
because, the anticipation of the two groups joining will create a good emotional arc.</p>

<h2>Roles for community members</h2>

<p>Assign roles to your community members.  This makes the event feel organic and creates a feeling of participation,
ownership and pride in your group.  You most definitely want this.  If you have more community members than you have
roles, create more roles: for example, the girls in our friend group have the tradition of crafting decorations for the
reception.  On the Friday before the wedding we created a &ldquo;Talent Show&rdquo; &hellip; but in a big way.  We asked anyone who
wanted to, to perform, and 7 groups agreed &hellip; there was a Trapeze Act, an Improv Comedy show, my parents, aunts and
uncles sang  traditional church music, one friend wrote the most amazing &ldquo;Gangsta Rap&rdquo; with biographical lyrics &hellip; I
created a playful &ldquo;program&rdquo; &hellip; Another friend mixed the drinks for us.  Another friend carried the train of Meg&rsquo;s
wedding dress.  We asked our best old friend to be the officiant and she wrote an incredible speech for us.</p>

<p>This is why the traditional wedding has roles for the community: the wedding party, the Best Man&rsquo;s speech, the Maid of
Honor&rsquo;s speech &hellip;</p>

<h2>Good news&mdash;spending more can make the feeling worse</h2>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After all, what really matters on your wedding day, what you‚Äôll remember ‚Äòtil you‚Äôre old and gray, is not so much how
it looked as how it felt.&rdquo;
&ndash;&ldquo;A Practical Wedding&rdquo; Meg Keene</p></blockquote>

<p>Meg and I both loved this quote and it summed up my experience of attending weddings.  The audience is supremely
intelligent and  cannot be fooled by mere expense and opulence.  In fact this can be off-putting as a sign of &ldquo;something
to prove&rdquo; and,  the distastefulness of waste.  And so, my favorite wedding of all time was done quite inexpensively, but
with great  attention, inventiveness, and love.  In general, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that relationship between price
and quality,  in weddings, is very slim.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Who are all these people?&rdquo;: Photoboards</h2>

<p>A wedding is a community building event.  Since this couple is going to stay together and may raise a baby, they are
going to need for their friends to coalesce around them.  There&rsquo;s a good chance that, in large, before the wedding, most
of the people you invite,  will have no idea who the others are.</p>

<p>The time flies by, and attendees will be lucky to gain a basic understanding of your family. The traditional structure
recognizes this and features your families and the wedding party, on purpose: so that the audience will take note of
them and realize they are important in your life.</p>

<p>But if you realize the &ldquo;educational nature&rdquo; of a wedding &hellip; you can come up with other means of explaining just who
everyone is.</p>

<p>My  way of doing this was to create a series of photoboards.  I organized them thematically: &ldquo;Our Folks&rdquo;, &ldquo;Childhood&rdquo;,
&ldquo;College / Travels&rdquo;, &ldquo;We Left our Hearts in San Francisco&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Meg &amp; Kevin&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After a number of false starts, I  figured out the cheapest way:  I bought five &ldquo;foam core&rdquo; boards (XXX dimensions).  I
sorterd &amp; selected the the pictures digitally (which was a huge job, looking through thousands of photos &hellip;).  I was
able to print these out on a color printer at  our local print shop (I think it cost something like $0.49 per page).
Then, I cut them out of the 8.5x11&#8221; sheets using the paper cutter at the  print shop.  Finally I pinned the photos to the
foam core using thumbtacks.</p>

<p>It was still a huge job!  But, this was the  speed / price compromise that I needed to make and, they were,
aesthetically in some ways, better than what I had originally planned.</p>

<p>And the photo boards were a huge success!  On the first evening, after the talent show, we saw some of our friends in the
dark dining hall (the lights were off), using their phones as flashlights to look through the photos.  Pictures are
inherently fascinating to people.  Even babies and toddlers understand pictures.</p>

<p>These pictures helped the wedding attendees understand who they all were, in relation to themselves (if that  makes
sense).  It helped to contextualize our lives, our families, our past, and the great value and meaning of this event
for us.</p>

<h2>Digital vs traditional invitations &ndash; and timing of digital invitations</h2>

<p>Weddings are an occasion when tradition takes over, and stipulates certain behaviors.  So, they evolves more slowly than
 normal life.  This is especially evident when you consider how the invitations and communications happen.</p>

<p>In modern  life, most people organize themselves digitally.  We send text messages or emails or Facebook messages to
choose a time &amp; place, and then we send reminders very soon beforehand.  You never need, anymore, to bring any physical
documents with you in order to locate where you&rsquo;re supposed to be, because you can always just look it up on your phone,
or send a text message to confirm.</p>

<p>Weddings break this, because people send paper invitations, and often skip electronic communications.  I think this is
actually risky and a bad way to follow tradition.</p>

<p>A quick story:</p>

<p>A few years ago, we were invited to Pim &amp; Shane&rsquo;s wedding in Southern California.  Pim had verbally told Meg that
the wedding was &ldquo;at her neighbor&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;  We flew to Southern California.  We spent a night near Laguna Beach, we had
a romantic dinner, we were enjoying ourselves.  On Saturday we realized, that we had forgotten the paper wedding
invitation at home.  But, no big deal because, Pim had told Meg that the wedding was at &ldquo;her neighbor&rsquo;s house&rdquo; and we
knew where Pim&rsquo;s house was.  (Everyone we knew well was in the wedding party, and we didn&rsquo;t want to bother them.)  So,
we found a hotel near to Pim&rsquo;s house, and giving ourselves plenty of time, we showered, changed, and took a taxi to
Pim&rsquo;s house, expecting the neighborhood to be crowded with tons of people.</p>

<p>Instead, we found the house absolutely deserted!  There wasn&rsquo;t a person in sight and, no obvious &ldquo;neighbor&rsquo;s house&rdquo;
where a wedding was taking place.  We finally got the bride&rsquo;s brother on the phone, Tandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wedding at?  We&rsquo;re at your house.  Is your neighbor&rsquo;s house around the corner?&rdquo;  We asked.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re at my
house?  Which house?  Our parents&#8217; house?&rdquo;  he asked, incredulously.  &ldquo;Really?  The wedding is 30 miles from there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With our San Francisco brains, we had imagined &ldquo;neighbor&rsquo;s house&rdquo; to be right down the street.  When, in reality, down
in SoCal, a &ldquo;neighbor&rsquo;s house&rdquo; could be 30 miles away.</p>

<p>We jumped back into the taxi.  We rushed back to the hotel.  We got our car and drove frantically.  We took a wrong
turn, and had to turn around in the middle of the freeway.  We just barely made it.  The bride was walking down the
aisle when we arrived.</p>

<p>For me the moral of the story is that (besides for the obvious one that we were stupid to forget the invitation in San
Francisco) for such an important event as a wedding, it&rsquo;s strange to totally change the way we communicate.</p>

<p>When Meg and I were married, we created a beautiful &ldquo;Save the Date&rdquo; card and mailed it out, months in advance, so that
people had something to hang on their refrigerators.  But, then we switched to digital communications.  We collected
everyone&rsquo;s email addresses and created beautiful, informative emails which we sent several times as the wedding neared.</p>

<p>And most importantly, 2 days before the wedding, I sent one final email to everyone that contained the address of our
wedding venue, so that, as people were traveling, they would have all the information they needed at hand, on their
phones.</p>

<h2>Videography: the uncharted territory of wedding photography</h2>

<p>We paid $2500 for a nice wedding photographer.  Professional wedding photographers are very good at one thing: lining
everyone up and taking traditional wedding pictures.  I think an amateur photographer might not have the crowd control
abilities to carve out the space for pictures.  And, those slightly staged pictures are invaluable.  They are some of
the best, highest quality pictures taken of folks in the prime of their lives.  Just look at your grandparents&#8217; wedding
pictures, if you are lucky enough to have them.  They&rsquo;re treasures.</p>

<p>But, a few things:</p>

<p>Our friend Ian, who is a great photographer, took about 600 pictures.  Since Ian knows, and is known by, our group of
friends, he was able to evoke very authentic, characteristic expressions and situations.  In many ways, I much prefer
Ian&rsquo;s photos (which were free) to the $2500 professional photographers photos.</p>

<p>Another thing is, we punted on the idea of a videographer.</p>

<p>Professional photographers don&rsquo;t tend to take video, I think it&rsquo;s either a different skill, hard to sell, or people
don&rsquo;t realize they want this.</p>

<p>However, if a picture is worth 1,000 words, a video must surely be worth a million.  You
most definitely want a video of your wedding ceremony, and of the special events during the reception.  When I look at
our wedding photos, I smile and they&rsquo;re cute.  When I watch the video of our ceremony, and of the special events during
the reception.  When I look at our wedding photos, I smile and they&rsquo;re cute.  When I watch the video of our ceremony, I am
transported back to that moment.  It is invaluable to me.</p>

<p>So, I think that wedding photographers should offer videography. In the absence of this, ask one of your mindful friends
to take a video with their iPhone.  Even a shitty video is infinitely better than none at all.  If you&rsquo;re at weddings,
look around and if no one else is recording the ceremony, pull out your iPhone and grab a recording of it.  The bride
and groom will be so thankful to you later.</p>

<h2>The logistical spreadsheet</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>Jung&rsquo;s thoughts on ceremonies marking transitions through life&rsquo;s phases</p>

<h2>The wedding, like a mass, is a very evolved ceremony and you should treat the various parts with respect.</h2>

<p>For example, I have never been a big fan of the garter &amp; bouquet toss.  They feel old-fashioned and, putting pressure on
the &ldquo;unmarried people&rdquo; is something I kinda resented, when I was unmarried.  However, this ceremony plays a role.  It
helps to transition the party from sit down dinner time, to dancing time.  The young people stand up and put on a show
for the older people &hellip; the young people will continue from here to dancing, and the older folks can observe, laugh,
and start conversations at the tables.  If you cut out this piece of the ceremony, you will have to invent your own
method to transition from dinnertime to dancing time.</p>

<h2>More thoughts on what weddings are and mean</h2>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Today, Andy &amp; Laurel got married, but really, I feel as if we all just did.&rdquo;   &mdash;Meg Kliman</p></blockquote>

<p>Traditionally, there&rsquo;s a good chance the union will produce children.  From the community&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s going to
have to care for these children.  As much as conservative people may think they&rsquo;re doing it all on their own, in
reality, it really does &ldquo;take a village&rdquo; to raise a child.  In the extreme case,  imagine if the parents were to die.
The care for the children would fall by default on the community.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the community should discourage unmarried people from sleeping together, because if they were to have a
child, it would be born into an unstable situation and the likelihood that the community would have to assume its care
is higher.</p>

<p>For more modern people, a wedding represents a small concretization of the community&rsquo;s social structure.  Even taking
the thought of children out, the mental leap, the transition into a new life phase, the desire of the couple to make a
commitment to one another &hellip; is the source of the value of the ritual.</p>

<p>So, now we can see the transaction that is taking place.  The community says: we will recognize and legitimize your
relationship, however, you basically have to prove to us that you&rsquo;re truly serious and, you have to swear your most
excellent oath to that effect.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Prove to us you&rsquo;re truly serious&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I think creating a wedding is a great way of doing this.  You are running a gauntlet. It is a most complicated and
involved test.  It takes sustained effort, patience, money and so forth.</p>

<p>Additionally, it has a huge element of play and should in fact be, a lot of fun &lsquo;cause, after all you are planning a
party.</p>

<p>On our wedding day, after I finished running back and forth to the ceremony meadow, arguing with the sound people about
which music they should play, after I gave my groomsmen each their own individually created carefully picked out gifts
.. after I finalized my vows &hellip; after I saw the community girls working merrily on their decorating projects &hellip; after
I explained to my restauranteur friend who we carefully chose to mix the reception cocktails &hellip; after I discussed with
the maid of honor&rsquo;s boyfriend, who we had asked to be our unofficial videographer &hellip; as I lined everyone up &hellip; as I
took Meg&rsquo;s hand and stared out at the audience &hellip; I was exhausted and, I simply could not wait to be married.</p>

<p>I eagerly desired with every fibre of my being that this transaction would be successfully completed.  The process had
literally wrung this feeling out of me.  And I think this is what Jung and Campbell are talking about when they discuss
ceremonies that shepard people through their life stages &hellip; what you&rsquo;re looking for is a psychological transformation
to take place &hellip; and for your unconscious self to recognize that you are now married.</p>

<h3>The ceremony</h3>

<p>The ceremony is much maligned &hellip; but really it is the moment, by far, that has the most potential.  It can be
heartbreakingly beautiful and meaningful.</p>

<p>It should be emotional!  It should give people an opportunity to cry.  To contemplate the slow human
drama.  It&rsquo;s much maligned as boring, incomprehensible, long &hellip; to this I say: You&rsquo;re in charge.  20-30 minutes is a
good length.  The ceremony can be too short or uneventful.  In this case, people will feel disappointed &hellip; they will
feel as if nothing much happened.</p>

<h3>While the groom is waiting for the bride</h3>

<p>The unspoken fear at this moment is that the bride (or groom) may not show up. It&rsquo;s ok to go slowly at this moment &hellip;
if you let the audience get a little nervous, they will feel a bigger catharsis at its resolution.  Additionally I think
playing beautiful and lonely music can heighten the feeling of emptiness and longing.</p>

<h3>The joy that the audience feels when the officiant declares: &ldquo;I present to you, for the very first time: Meg &amp; Kevin</h3>

<p>Trowbridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>TODO &hellip; this is the joy of new life</p>

<h3>A ritual that helps you to transition into a new stage of life</h3>

<p>The bride and groom are playing archetypal roles.  The bride is &ldquo;everywoman&rdquo; and the groom &ldquo;everyman.&rdquo;  When people
watch your wedding, they are either anticipating, or reliving, their own.</p>

<p>Additionally, it marks one of the major transitions in life, from childhood, to maturity, and so it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;once in a
lifetime&rdquo; moment.  Life stretches from this moment, towards death.  There&rsquo;s a good chance the couple will procreate and
have a baby.</p>

<p>All this inevitably pushes the mind towards meaningful thoughts of life and death.  This is well and good and the source
of the great power of weddings.</p>

<p>People get so egocentric about weddings.  It is good to label these tendencies as &ldquo;groomzillo&rdquo; and &ldquo;bridezilla.&rdquo;  On one
level yes, it is a celebration of your relationship and your lives to this point &hellip; but (see elsewhere in this essay)
it is also a universal human ceremony that is meaningful to everyone involved.  It&rsquo;s not really all about you, it&rsquo;s
about your evolving role in your community.</p>

<p>So the right philosophy is to express your love and respect for you wife and your guests by serving them in the creation
of a comfortable, respectful, beautiful celebration.  Perhaps the biggest and most meaningful party you will ever
create.  Do not focus on yourself and &ldquo;your special day.&rdquo;  Put the focus on your mate and on your guests.</p>

<h3>Wedding is an  emotional arc</h3>

<p>A truly great album will have a shape to it: start with a bang to earn &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo; &hellip; don&rsquo;t blow your
best material, save it for the end.  Will you have multiple peaks and mellow periods, or will you have simpler shape?</p>

<p>If you have good control over your material, you can meld a satisfying arc.</p>

<blockquote><p>‚ÄúMost of our best numbers were in what I call the tempo of the heartbeat. That‚Äôs the tempo that strikes people easiest
because, without their knowing it, they are moving to that pace all their waking hours. Music to me is sex‚Äîit‚Äôs all tied
up somehow, and the rhythm of sex is the heartbeat. I usually try to avoid scoring a song with a climax at the end.
Better to build about two-thirds of the way through, and then fade to a surprise ending. More subtle. I don‚Äôt really
like to finish by blowing and beating in top gear.‚Äù</p></blockquote>

<h2>Grooms&#8217; broken &ldquo;cultural script&rdquo;</h2>

<p>I read many books, my favorite of which was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Wedding-Affordable-Meaningful-Celebration/dp/0738215155">A Practical
Wedding</a> &hellip; and did a lot of
research online.  I was quite impressed with our society&rsquo;s cultural script for grooms.  Grooms are supposed to be:
man-children who think the whole wedding is crazy and nonsense &ldquo;women are crazy&rdquo; so just put up with them and say yes to
whatever they demand the bachelor party is the the most important part of the wedding and, at the bachelor party you
just HAVE to have sex with a stripper, do cocaine, and get into fights .. it&rsquo;s not hard to find the most demeaning
obnoxious advice imaginable, directed at grooms.</p>

<p>I was very interested in the wedding.  I paid for about half of it.  I read a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/fashion/weddings/04FIELD.html">New York Times article titled &ldquo;Burden of
Paying for Wedding Bells Shifts</a>  which mentioned</p>

<p>Imagine, instead of a wedding, you were planning a huge, no-expenses party for the most important people in your life.
What is more, you get to introduce different groups of people (your college friends, your wife&rsquo;s friends, your old
roommates in the city, your family, your wife&rsquo;s family) to one another.  It&rsquo;s literally a reunion of all your loved ones
and a celebration of your life, up to that point.  Before the wedding, when you mention &ldquo;Kate Elston, she&rsquo;s in Meg&rsquo;s

should hang out.&rdquo;  Anyways, hypothetically speaking, you enjoy parties, right?  Would you want to be totally
disconnected, marginalized, and kicked out of the planning of this party?  Of course not!  Don&rsquo;t you care about who will
be invited, where it will be, what you will be doing?  The music that will played at the dance party?  The food that you
will eat?  The alcohol that you will drink? Do you like eating food and drinking beer?</p>

<p>Are you a grown man?  Are you good at planning things?  Do you have good decision making skills, are you good at
logistics?  Do you have good taste in music, food, and drink?</p>

<p>I basically suggest chucking the cultural script in the garbage bin and taking an active role in planning thew wedding.</p>

<p>Seriously though, men&rsquo;s traditional strengths in planning &amp; logistics have a huge role to play in creating a smoothly</p>

<p>People won&rsquo;t know why your wedding felt good, but they will remember the absence of drama, the feeling of the care that
went into planning out each detail and having</p>
