### THE EMPEROR OF MALADIES

This “biography” of cancer is relevant to everyone and, due to its superb writing (considering the difficulty of the 
subject), it’s amazingly accessible.  The book flows so well: it's paced like a thriller, you hardly notice how much 
you're learning. It's like in the Matrix where Neo states: "I know Kung Fu," except in this case "I know cancer." 
Not as cool but tragically, more useful.

This was my favorite book of 2014 and the one I most recommend others read.

### TALES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC

TALES OF THE SOUTH PACFIC by James Michener is a rare book which communicates what it felt like to be involved in WWII. 
The budding genius author Michener had the privileged viewpoint of being "embedded" with the Navy during the war. He 
then lightly fictionalizes, organizes, and distills his experiences into 19 highly varied short stories which communicate 
something about what it felt like, and what it meant.

[full review](/2014-11-22-book-review-tales-of-the-south-pacific)

WWII in the Pacific and the Pacific in general was a theme for me this year.  I loved Michener’s 
<a href="http://www.kevinmtrowbridge.com/2014-10-24-book-review-hawaii">HAWAII</a>, but this is a 1100 page epic and, it’s rather a deep dive.  But if 
you want a deeper understanding of Hawaii it’s a great start.  I read two WWII Submarine narratives by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Beach,_Jr.">Edward Beach</a>, 
a legendary Navy officer: 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Submarine-Classic-Account-Undersea-Combat/dp/0743487990">SUBMARINE!</a> and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silent-Deep-Cassell-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304364657/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419886465&sr=1-3">RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP</a> &#8230; and we watched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Silent,_Run_Deep_%281958_film%29">movie version of Run Silent, Run Deep</a>.


### A STILLNESS AT APPOMATTOX

You come to have huge respect for Bruce Catton for his ability to convey poetical feeling and overarching meaning
via rock solid factual underpinning.  He writes how, at the peak of the war:

> &#8220;the nation itself had been heated to an unimaginable pitch &#8230; and now it had been put on the anvil, and the 
  hammer was remorselessly coming down, beating a 
  glowing metal into a different shape.&#8221;

The description of the horrifically gone wrong [Battle of the Crater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Crater) 
helped me understand just how tired, hungry, and ill, the soldiers were, and additionally, likely poorly educated with 
little ability to communicate using writing or maps.

Also, if only the Union Army had Google Maps!  So many things went wrong because, entire armies were lead in the wrong
direction and, bumbled into one another in random ways.

### THE PORTABLE BENJAMIN FRANKLIN

Every time I think I know everything about Franklin, I learn something new. For example, did you know about his love for 
swimming, that he was a leader in swimming education, and that he invented kiteboarding? He chased a whirlwind on his 
horse until a tree fell nearby &#8220;alerting him of the danger.&#8221; He invented Daylight Savings Time? He exchanged letters 
with David Hume? It just goes on and on.

### THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES

The work of Jung & Campbell is the point where the modern, secular western world is wrestling with the questions of 
life, death, and existence. The western world is just like me: traditional religions are not providing meaningful 
answers any more. But, that doesn’t we should give up wondering: we need to keep struggling. That’s what Jung and 
Campbell are doing and they are pointing the way for others to follow: people like me.

### FOUNDERS AT WORK: STORIES OF STARTUPS’ EARLY DAYS

The best business work I read all year.  You have to read between the lines to realize that the author Jessica 
Livingston married the Y Combinator founder (and prolific essay writer) Paul Graham during the course of this book.  

Perhaps this explains the amazing access Ms. Livingston had to some amazing startup founders.  I really appreciate the 
interview style of writing as, it allows the unique personality of each interviewee to come through.  For example, the 
interview with Steve Wozniak made me tear up.  Other big names include Craig Newark of Craigslist, Charles Geschke of 
Adobe, David Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals and creator of Ruby on Rails, and on and on:

### READY PLAYER ONE

To finish with a purely fun entry: Ready, Player One is a great cyberpunk thriller &#8211;  similar to Snow Crash, but more 
poppy, easier to read, and a more classic plot. A huge amount of effort got put into all of the 80s references and the 
excellent plot.  The book is a joy to read.

## Stats

In 2013 I read 20 books.  

For 2014, I was very ambitious and challenged myself to read 50 books during the year.
Sadly I fell down fairly hard on my challenge and only read 25 books during the year.  However, if you go by pages
read the picture looks a little better &#8216;cause I read about 1.5 times as many pages in 2014.

## Method

For about three years I&#8217;ve had a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seconds-pro-interval-timer/id363978811?mt=8">timer app on my iphone</a>
that I use for reading, meditation, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a> while working.

So, I use this app to force myself to read at least 20 minutes each morning with my coffee.  I 
<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/kevinmtrowbridge/goals/read">log this time on Beeminder</a> 
to make it somewhat &#8220;official.&#8221;

This year I experimented with reading for 45 minutes each day, but I found after 20 minutes I started getting anxious 
about work and getting going with my day.  Since I know I waste at least an hour each day reading low quality 
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/kevinmtrowbridge/">Reddit</a> & 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kmtrowbr">Hacker News</a> posts, I find this anxiety illogical.  The time
I spend reading is some of the highest quality time I have each day.  So this year I will try once again to cut down on 
low quality internet reading and up my daily book reading time to 45m.  In the past I blocked these sites from our home
internet, but since I could easily bypass it by using the iPhone&#8217;s LTE connection, I found the block to be just annoying.
I do wish that I could use a service like <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com">RescueTime</a> on the iPhone because, 
I could set it up to only allow 30m of &#8220;distracting&#8221; internet browsing per day.  There&#8217;s hope that the iOS 8 will eventually
[allow RescueTime to work on iPhone](http://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-apps-for-tracking-iPhone-usage-the-way-RescueTime-does-on-Mac)
though.

I did about 50% of the reading on Kindle this year.  I read a surprising amount of real paper books this year, however.
Often the specific (sometimes obscure) books I wanted weren&#8217;t available for Kindle.  I don&#8217;t mind because I&#8217;ve been
having fun changing how I read. Earlier in the year I saw some neat blog posts 
<a href="http://blog.highfivehq.com/posts/a-little-known-hack-from-japan-to-get-your-notebook-organized">about</a> 
<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/dec/03/weapon-for-readers/">note taking</a>
<a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/10/23/deep-habits-create-an-idea-index/">while reading</a> so, I&#8217;ve been using
a pen as my bookmark and, challenging myself to make at least 3 marks on each page.  This slows down my reading but it
definitely increases my engagement with the text.  This year I will probably upgrade my Kindle to the new 
[Kindle Voyage](http://www.amazon.com/High-Resolution-Display-Adaptive-PagePress-Sensors/dp/B00IOY8XWQ) and I think this
will allow me to do more note taking while reading on the Kindle.  I also think the Voyage will allow me to read more PDFs and
content not bought from Amazon.

Another way of increasing my engagement with the text is to write more reviews of what I read.  
[This year](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12053631-kevin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&utf8=%E2%9C%93&read_at=2014&view=table&sort=review&order=d&per_page=100) I reviewed
13 out of 25 books (52%).  Whereas 
[last year](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12053631-kevin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&utf8=%E2%9C%93&read_at=2013&view=table&sort=review&order=d&per_page=100)
I only reviewed 3/20 (15%).  

Another thought I had is that, the most &#8220;hackable&#8221; moment of reading is really, choosing the next book to read.  I have
a problem where I tend to be overly ambitious.  I choose dense, long, difficult books and this slows me down a lot.  I
have this concept of &#8220;reading momentum&#8221; where, you have to switch off between quick, fun, pleasure reads which boost your
momentum, and long, difficult, meaty reads, which slow you down.  (However, if you just read quick easy books, there&#8217;s the
danger you&#8217;ll start to lose respect for reading in general.  Because there are many pulpy, low quality books out there
that aren&#8217;t really worth reading.)

Anyways, to try and choose better books to read, I&#8217;ve created a 
[&#8220;reading list&#8221; spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vR4lsU_6_hAKgT2RuxovDkgiL-_jEP4NngaixlwCVP4/edit?usp=sharing)
and I&#8217;m trying to develop a &#8220;formula&#8221; based on the Amazon rating and number of reviews, and my own interest in the book,
as well as shifting between different subject areas over time.  2015 should prove whether this idea can help me to pick
better books to read.]]></content>

I am fascinated by WWII and, have read probably a hundred books by historians, memoirs by soldiers and sailors, and so 
forth. Those are wonderful books but, they are nonfiction and fairly dry. They tell you a lot about what happened and 
why, but not much about how it felt.

For example, take WAR IN THE BOATS by William Ruhe. This is a WWII Pacific submarine memoir and an exact contemporary of 
TOTSP. The difference is, Ruhe is not a novelist. He tells you as best he can, what it was like but, one must be a 
mature reader to project context, feelings, and meaning onto the (indisputably incredible) story he tells. That is to 
say, Ruhe gives you the skeleton but it's quite dry to read. 

As I get older I often prefer more facts and less embellishment but, that's because I am better able to fill in the 
details myself, and also the embellishment is often poorly done and ends up reducing your trust in the author and 
detracting from the story.

Michener is talented enough that, he embellishes terrifically and, is becoming one of my special authors:

I first read Michener's HAWAII during a trip to that isle. Intrigued, I dug into Michener's origins and discovered 
TALES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, published in 1947. It won the Pulitzer Prize and was adapted by Rogers & Hammerstein for 
the musical SOUTH PACIFIC. 

After this amazing beginning Michener went on to become one of the 20th century's most prolific authors, writing huge 
historical epics (HAWAII was the first).

I found TALES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC to be more literary than HAWAII. Whereas Hawaii was a "historical epic genre novel", 
his ambition in this book is more intimate and personal, and more true, like literature is true, with difficult to 
express real human situations, and great breadth.

Michener, an orphan raised by a Quaker, made very good use of his fortune, to the point where in wikipedia I read: 
"Michener became a major philanthropist, donating more than US$100 million to educational and writing institutions."

I haven't read his other epics yet although I think THE SOURCE may be next on my list.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[While planning a Hawaiian vacation, I realized that my ignorance was profound. Searching for understanding, I read 
Michener's HAWAII. This was a wonderful introduction. Wow! What an epic story! I heartily recommend. Despite its great 
length it's fairly easy to read -- say, about three times as hard as Harry Potter, but something an intelligent high 
schooler could greatly enjoy and, benefit from.

The book's greatness grew on me. At first I chuckled at what I saw as a clumsy demonization of a 19th century 
missionary. But ... then it began reminding me of Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN, where the telling of a story via 
"cartoon characters" was simply a requirement for constructing an epic. Both novels are ripping good cartoons, but when 
taken as a whole, far more than that. You feel bamboozled by master showmen, but also inspired and educated. Michener 
is not the poet that Steinbeck is, but he is an intellectual with many ideas: about the nature of islands, religion, 
racism, time and what survives, and WWII.

At times the way that events and characters would be bound together across hundreds of years (and pages) struck me and 
the effort put into the book showed.

If you can draw a moral from these pages, it is a pragmatic one. The characters who survive and thrive are the ones who 
are awake and adapt. The morally or intellectually lazy and brittle ones suffer and are forgotten, because time presses 
on and something new is always coming. In the end, I think Michener's sympathy lies with life itself. You see the 
cartoonization going on but, at different points in the book he argues for, ultimately conflicting positions so clearly, 
that you are hard pressed to pin him down as a Christian, Buddhist, Atheist, or a Republican or a Democrat or ... you 
see what I mean. He transcends easy labels.

This book is a great way to get a feel for "the meaning" of history, and the end result is, that I feel inspired to read 
more, and be more. 

Thanks, James Michener! I think TALES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC may be my next book.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This is a difficult, but fantastic book. Difficult, because it's very painful to relive the tragedy of all the lives 
destroyed by cancer. Fantastic, because the book flows so well: it's paced like a thriller, you hardly notice how much 
you're learning. It's like in the Matrix where Neo states: "I know Kung Fu," except in this case "I know cancer." Not as 
cool but tragically, more useful.

The opening historical section left me deeply moved by the suffering and and nobility of the patients, and somewhat 
shocked by the daring of the doctors throughout the years, but also just amazed at the tenacity they've brought to the 
job, trying approach after approach and making slow, but, significant progress. 

Then, in the second section, it's exciting and satisfying to experience the discovery of genetic cancer therapies 
starting in the mid-70s. I now have a working knowledge of oncogenes, oncoviruses, and the history and method of 
cancer's surgical, chemological, and genetic therapies. The medical writing is amazingly clear.

The book left me cautiously optimistic about the development of more and more nontoxic, genetic cancer therapies in the 
coming years. It has been a long, long, incredibly painful slog, but we are making progress.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[A surprisingly challenging book and, just respect, mad respect. All hail B. Franklin, Printer of Philadelphia!

My new favorite: [Dialogue Between Franklin and the Gout](http://www.bartleby.com/109/3.html).

Every time I think I know everything about him, I learn something new. For example, did you know that Benjamin Franklin 
loved swimming, that he was a leader in swimming education, and that he invented kiteboarding? He chased a whirlwind on 
his horse until a tree fell nearby "alerting him of the danger." He invented Daylight Savings Time? He exchanged letters 
with David Hume? It just goes on and on.

A huge blast of life radiates from these writings, 300 years after their composition.
